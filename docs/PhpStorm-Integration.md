# Functional PHP Preprocessor - Immutable data type generator

## PhpStorm Interation

Do the following after installing FPP into your project.

1) First you'll need to install the [File Watchers plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/settings-tools-file-watchers.html), if you haven't already done so.
To install the plugin, go to the PhpStorm Settings/Preferences -> "Plugins" -> and search for "File Watchers". Check off the plugin to install it. You'll need to restart PhpStorm.

2) Now we need to create an FPP file type.
In the PhpStorm Settings/Preferences -> "Editor" -> "File Types".
Add a new file type, click at the "Recognized File Types" section on the "+" icon.
Put the name to "FPP" and description to "FPP files" (or whatever you'd like).
Add `//` as Line comment, `/*` as Block comment start and `*/` as Block comment end.
Set the keywords to:

```
namespace
use
data
bool
string
float
int
enum
uuid
guid
event
command
{
|
}
=
:
```

If you want to have more colors, put the following to the Tab `2` of keywords:

```
{
|
}
=
:
```

Then click on OK.
In the "Registered Patterns" section (with FPP selected above), click on the "+" icon and add `*.fpp`, then click OK.

3) Configure the File Watcher.
In the PhpStorm Settings/Preferences -> "Tools" -> "File Watchers".
Click on the "+" icon and choose "<custom>" for the template.
Put "FPP" as name.
Select FPP as the File type.
Select your Scope, if you don't have one, create it. Set it to `src` for example.
Set "Programm" to `php`.
Set this as "Arguments": `$ProjectFileDir$/vendor/prolic/fpp/bin/fpp.php $FilePath$`
Enter an output path, such as `$Sourcepath$` (PHPStorm will refresh this path to look for changes to the generated classes)
Disable the checkbox "Auto-save edited files to trigger the watcher" – in my experience this is really awkward.
Select "On error" for "Show Console".
Click OK.

Try it out! Have fun!

# Advanced Options

## If you have `.fpp` files that reference classes defined in other `.fpp` files

The default "Arguments" setting works great if you only have one `.fpp` file *or* every `.fpp` file only references classes defined in that same file.

If you have multiple `.fpp` files and one or more of them reference a class defined in another `.fpp`, you will get an error. To combat this, you can specify a directory as a part of the "Arguments" instead of the exact file that changed.

For example, consider the following files that define value objects, events and commands for Accounts, Forms, Subscriptions and Users.

```
config
└── model
    ├── account.fpp
    ├── form.fpp
    ├── subscription.fpp
    └── user.fpp
```

In this case, the commands and events for Form (from `form.fpp`) and Subscription (from `subscription.fpp`) reference `AccountId` (from `account.fpp`).

Changes to `form.fpp` would trigger `$ProjectFileDir$/vendor/bin/fpp $ProjectFileDir$/config/model/form.fpp`. This will cause an error as `form.fpp` references `AccountId` which is not itself defined in `form.fpp`. However, if we change the "Arguments" to the following, everything works:

> $ProjectFileDir$/vendor/bin/fpp $ProjectFileDir$/config/model

This is because when `form.fpp` changes, all `.fpp` files in the directory are rebuilt together by `fpp`. This means `form.fpp` and `subscription.fpp` can safely find `AccountId` that is defined in `account.fpp`.
